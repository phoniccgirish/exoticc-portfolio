            Scheduling an appointment with Career Services 
            staff gives you a chance for some practical advice and guidance on how to highlight the skills and experience you have to offer.</p>
        <p style="margin:10px 0px 10px 20px" class="paragraph">During your session, we will sift through your skills and pass along ideas 
            for layout and formatting your materials.
            We also assist with cover letters, schedule mock interviews, and offer a private cubicle space you can reserve for virtual or in-person interviews
            with potential employers, giving you a full range of support as you explore career opportunities.
